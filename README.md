Space. Shapes. Danger. ENEMY APPROACHING

Classes of Ships? Classing/Sizing System based on special jargon/lingo/terminology and numerals, then specific name of ship?
something like:
Sprit Klasse Mk IIA, Badboy
Elfe Klasse Mk I, Zauberhexe
Geld Klasse Mk IVD, Tohokami
Planeten Klasse Mk IC, Gotthand
etc..

Space stations, what is available?
Ship docking, little shops like a space market maybe. like small governments/ townships, with their own sovreign security forces
Some might be state controlled, other companycities like the commercially owned and governed residential areas in snow crash.

Diffusal blasts, modes of firing, scatter missles, seeking missles.
Laser/pulse laser diffusual / radiation blasts

The laser modem idea is amazing.

Should force fields exist? I think maybe not, bloody, wreckage strewn battlefields, not shiny deflector arrays and shit.
-Physical / Magnetic shielding could exist but magnetic would require a lot of power/ physical would only be effective to a point
could have floating physical shield arrays in front of certain types of ships
