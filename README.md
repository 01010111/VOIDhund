Space. Shapes. Danger. ENEMY APPROACHING

Classes of Ships? Classing/Sizing System based on special jargon/lingo/terminology and numerals, then specific name of ship?
something like:
Sprit Klasse Mk IIA, Badboy
Elfe Klasse Mk I, Zauberhexe
Geld Klasse Mk IVD, Tohokami
Planeten Klasse Mk IC, Gotthand
etc..

Space stations, what is available?
Ship docking, little shops like a space market maybe. like small governments/ townships, with their own sovreign security forces
Some might be state controlled, other companycities like the commercially owned and governed residential areas in snow crash.

Diffusal blasts, modes of firing, scatter missles, seeking missles.
Laser/pulse laser diffusual / radiation blasts

The laser modem idea is amazing.

Should force fields exist? I think maybe not, bloody, wreckage strewn battlefields, not shiny deflector arrays and shit.
-Physical / Magnetic shielding could exist but magnetic would require a lot of power/ physical would only be effective to a point
could have floating physical shield arrays in front of certain types of ships

Near earth setting with x number of set political factions at start of game.

Warp mirrors? like giant quantum reflecty things that boost the warp capabilities of ships, but statically placed or in orbit (?). many of them can be lined up
at intervals of xyz 1000 kilometers (AU?) to create warp roads (corridors?).

Ground forces. Spider tanks!

Orbital, high and low altitude bombing.  An orbital strike could be devastating, but has a lot of collateral damage to cities and structures,
as well as both sides of a battle if already fielding ground forces.  Planets suffer greatly and the resources become less usable and socioeconomic structures
become more unstable with greater amounts of collateral damage due to planetary wars.  You can also field troops and low altitude air support
for surgical strikes to topple governments/forces or factions strategically.

Technology is open ended and active, and generally controlled by companies and or governments.  Research and tech in various weaponizable topics usually
progresses at a relatively slow pace, but sometimes a breakthrough is made, which will benefit a certain organization in control of that
research or technology.  Corporate espionage and backchannel connections can be a useful alternative if you do not have
the power for your faction to forcibly extract the technology.

Information Warfare.

Direct ship hacking
Distribution / Link method; Low powered laser infiltration, Crab claws, nanoinfiltration.
Manual or automatic control options for hacking systems.
Frequency hacking
Hacking of channels or codes used in ship to ship communication, or long range subspace communication.
Information spoofing
Spoofing information about your ship's flight log, callsign, or docking permits, etc.
Terminal hacking
Hacking out sensitive information from normally public terminals such as at space stations and ground facilities, or even transport liners you are riding on using some softs

Ammunition, supplies, repairs, crew wages, and regular maintenance all cost money.

Space pirates / Rogue groups outside of any particular faction, out to make money for themselves and take advantage of the weak
but are not vying to be recognized as the universal government of space
